# Kickstarting With Excel
## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise.

### Purpose
The overall analysis is composed of kickstarter campaigns launched from various countries. The campaigns vary in categories such as food trucks, television series, music, and much more.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did have some difficulty getting used to creating some of the charts and getting familiar with which data point goes where. My biggest challenge was plugging in the countifs formula. I had assumed that even after ***sorting*** the data on the kickstarter sheet that I wouldn't have to plug in "successful', and "plays" keywords into the formula. Not only that but I kept plugging in the wrong column into the equation which would result in an error in value.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart below shows theater kickstarter campaigns launched throughout the year. May and June had a much higher success rate than the campaigns launched in the later months.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The campaigns that had extremely high fundraising goals have a trend of not meeting their goal as shown in the chart below.

## Results
After gathering all the data given and organizing we can conclude that the campaigns launched in May and June resulted in a high success rate. It is also shown that the campaigns that asked for less funding ended up having a higher success rate than the ones that asked for a lot more funding. So if Louise !
wanted to start her own musical she should look into starting it into the summer months rather than later throughout the year. And also to keep the fundraising goals around the $1000-$5000 range. There could be one limitation to this dataset that could skew the data. The dataset collected comes from various countries all over the world. We could face the issue where if one country is just not that into theater or don't have a good theater program to which the campaign failed, regardless of meeting their fundraising goals. The location of these campaigns can be crucial to their success. If we were to have another chart where we could include which country each campaign was at then maybe we could some more context on which campaigns were successful.
