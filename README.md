Take a look at the average, marked as an "X", for example. The average fundraising goal was $4,000. The average money that was **actually** funded was ***less than half*** of the goal.


A suggestion for anyone interested in launching their own musical would be to ***plan the launch in the summer months.*** People seem to attend these events during these times.
