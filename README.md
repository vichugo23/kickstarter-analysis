Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise.

The chart below shows musical kickstarter campaigns launched throughout the year. May and June had a much higher success rate than the campaigns launched in the later months.

The campaigns that had extremely high fundraising goals have a trend of not meeting their goal as shown in the chart below.

Take a look at the average, marked as an "X", for example. The average fundraising goal was $4,000. The average money that was **actually** funded was ***less than half*** of the goal.


A suggestion for anyone interested in launching their own musical would be to ***plan the launch in the summer months.*** People seem to attend these events more during these times. 

Another suggestion, due to these trends shown above, would be to have a lower fundraising goal of ***around $2,000.*** There's a tendency of asking for *too much* money early on that it could seem intimidating to most, ending with the result of not coming anywhere near the fundraising goal.
